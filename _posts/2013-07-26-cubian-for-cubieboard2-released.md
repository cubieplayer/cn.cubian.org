For those first heard of this distribution. Please take a look at our [github Repository](https://github.com/cubieplayer/Cubian). We use Linux Kernel 3.3.0 for cubieboard2 instead of 3.4.43 on cubieboard1.

# Note
The module gpio_sunxi and mali is compiled, but not workes. It the driver problem. Hope cubietech can do something to make it work on cuieboard2.
